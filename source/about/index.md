I am pursuing the bachelor’s degree in Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Risk Management Science.

I will graduate from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in July, then I will go to The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology for a master's degree in Science, majoring in Financial Technology.

I will share my code on my [Github](https://github.com/augustjjlin). If you have any suggestions, you can [email](mailto:august.jjlin@gmail.com) me. Also, you can view my profile from my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/augustjjlin/).
